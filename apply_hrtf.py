This is the main file of my (Balduin Dettling, dbalduin (at)
student.ethz.ch) binaural audio generation project. The goal is to take an
audio file, along with a function that maps time to a point on the
unit sphere, and make another audio file that sounds as if the sound source
was moving around the listener according to the given function.

For this, I need measurements of HRTFs from different directions (1) (head
related transfer functions - the impulse responses of the human ears and
head). Luckily, that has already been done several times - in this project
I used a database of HRTF measurements spaced about 15 degrees.

The main challenge of the project then became interpolation, that is
creating a HRTF for an angle for which we don't have a measurement. The
simplest thing to do would be linearly interpolating between adjacent
HRTFs, which didn't work well because the difference in signal delay
sometimes causes unwanted constructive or destructive interference.

Another, slightly more advanced approach, which is now used in the project,
is what we call "delay compensated interpolation" (2). We first determine the
delay difference (3) between two signals between which we want to
interpolate. Then we remove the delay in the second signal (which is just a
shift in time), so that the signals have the same delay and delay
difference 0. We then linearly interpolate between the two signals,
according to an interpolation parameter alpha in [0,1]. To this
interpolated signal we add back an interpolated delay, which again is just
the linear interpolation between the delay differences of the two adjacent
measured impulse response.

Using this interpolation method, I then constructed a 2d interpolation
function, interpolate_2d, which is explained thoroughly in a comment in the
function itself.

Now we have a method to get a decent HRTF for any point on the sphere
(well, except if the elevation angle is below -45ยบ, because the database
doesn't have measurements there). The rest of the challenge consists in
applying these HRTFs to a signal with a moving sound source. I experimented
with several methods, and have arrived at the abomination that is
make_signal_move_2d. It is also explained in a comment within the function
itself.

(1): If you want to do a slightly simpler project, consider doing away with
HRTFs and just try to recreate the amplitude and delay differences between
the ears from all possible angles.

(2): Implementation in delay_compensated_interpolation_with_delaydiff

(3): The delay difference of two signals is, loosely speaking, the distance
between the positions of the main peaks in the respective HRTF. The actual
definition is its implementation (Salamon would be proud of me), which is
the function delaydifference in ./upsample_irs.m, where we cross-correlate
the two impulse responses and basically return the position of the peak of
that signal in comparison to the middle of it (where the peak would be if
the two signals were the same)

	again to represent an elevation angle between the two adjacent ones.

	concerns/thoughts/ideas:

	  the two calls of the 1d interpolation function and use them for the
	  final interpolation along the azim direction. this probably involves
	  a new, slightly different version of the function (although the old
	  one could easily be redefined in terms of the new one to avoid
	  redundancy).
	- this will be (at least) 3x slower than 1d interpolation, so using
	  this function incentivizes also implementing the make_signal_move
	  function in a more efficient manner, as outlined in a comment there.

	trivially holds if the signals shifted delta functions, and it seems to

	This function makes the audio signal in_signal sound as if the sound
	source was moving according to elev_azim_function.

	First of all, the obvious thing to do would be:

		divide the input signal into chunks of size K, with each chunk starting at sample j = n*k
		initialize the output signal to zeros, with a length slightly longer than the input signal*
		for each chunk, do this:
			evaluate elev_azim_function at j, and calculate an interpolated HRTF at this (elev, azim) point
			convolve the chunk with the interpolated HRTF
			add the convolved chunk to the output signal at the right place (see: overlap-and-add)
		return the output signal

		* because convolving two signals a and b gives you a signal of length len(a) + len(b) - 1

	Now, K needs to be small (empirically, < 50-100, depending on how fast you move the
	sound source) for the signal to sound good and not have any 'clicks' from a sudden change of the
	HRTF. However, the smaller we choose K, the more often we will have to call the 2d interpolation
	function, which is quite expensive.

	To remedy this, we divide each chunk into "subchunks", and while we calculate a new HRTF for
	every chunk with our fancy 2d delay compensated interpolation function, we only linearly
	interpolate for each subchunk, which is much faster. Now, the subchunk size can be chosen quite
	small, like 16 or 32 samples, and the chunk size can be a bit larger than without subchunks,
	like 128-1024.  Again, this all depends on how quickly you move the sound source, the faster it
	moves, the lower you need to choose the chunk and subchunk sizes. (idea for the future:
	dynamically adjust the chunk and subchunk sizes depending on the current speed of the sound
	source)
